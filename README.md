We created an tool that will collect all domainnaims that exist

Steps that the scripts perform:
 - Permutation of characters in an array in a for loop recursively
 - Adds the domain of to each loop
 - Checks if the URL exist if so we also collect the IP

The output can be easyly stored to a file:

```
javac com.java
java com > com.csv
```
